# Conceptual Captions (2,902,649 images)

These are jpeg compressed at level 75% then gzip compressed with level 9 to get the storage size from 400 GiB to around 50 GiB.

I made the mistake of downscaling some of these more than necessary because I didn't have the right ImageMagick parameters set. Images were downsized to one dimension being 320px, meaning images with a non-square aspect ratio can dip below 256px (i.e. 320x240). Sorry about that. 

captions: Haven't preprocessed these yet.
