# (WIP) dalle-pytorch-datasets

### This is a work in progress. 
None of this code works yet. If you'd like to contribute, create a pull request! We need all the datasets we can get. Otherwise come back in a few weeks to check on progress.

This repository includes metadata and instructions for downloading many captioned datasets. 

Thanks to @yashbonde, we eventually intend to include generated captions for a variety of datasets that don't include captions.
