# OpenImagesV6 with "Localized Annotations" (504,416 images)

This is a pretty clean dataset and works decently in my efforts. We need more, but you'll be able to see it generalize to a (very limited) degree after a full epoch.

Some of the captions will exceed the token length of 256. **You will need to trim these or throw them out in your DataLoader.**
